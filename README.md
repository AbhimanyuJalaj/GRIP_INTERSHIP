# GRIP_INTERSHIP
This repsitory contain files of GRIPS intership at The Sparks Foundation


All the files in the program is remotely accessed through server.
If server not work than all data is given at https://github.com/AbhimanyuJalaj/GRIP_INTERSHIP/blob/master/DATASET_IF_LINK_NOT_WORK.zip

1) Ipython notebook : https://github.com/AbhimanyuJalaj/GRIP_INTERSHIP/blob/master/solstudy.ipynb
   In this notebook, Regression algorithm for studyhours and score dataset is applied. 
   It might be possible that plotly figures are not visible. Don't worry. Run the notebook on local machine, it fix the problem.
   Copy paste the code in https://github.com/AbhimanyuJalaj/GRIP_INTERSHIP/blob/master/solstudy.ipynb to get the same output as given in the notebook.
   Delete the code of entire cell of xTrain ,yTrain, xTest, yTest then paste these four line of code in it.
